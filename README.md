# An alternative to SD Maid, and one that is completely free and open source!

Tired of the abundance of phone cleaners on the play store? Tired of 
them being extremely shady? Tired of them doing nothing? Tired of ads? 
Tired of having to pay? Me too.

Android API 23+ (Marshmallow) no 
longer allows apps to clean other app's caches, thus the claim of 
cleaners clearing them is completely false.

The only thing they can clean: log files, temporary files, and empty folders. All three LTE Cleaner wipes.

__LTE Cleaner is %100 free, open source, ad free, and deletes everything it claims too.

Optional filters:
- .apk files
- .log files
- .tmp files
- .cache files
- empty folders
